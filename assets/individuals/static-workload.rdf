    <problem>![alt text](http://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/icons/static_workload_icon.png "Logo Title Text 1") `How can an equal utilization be characterized and how can applications experiencing this workload benefit from cloud computing?`</problem>
    <context>### Context
Static Workloads are characterized by a more-or-less flat utilization profile over time within certain boundaries.</context>
    <solution>### Solution  
An application experiencing Static Workload is less likely to benefit from an elastic cloud that offers a pay-per-use billing, because the number of required resources is constant.
